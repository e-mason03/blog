I'm Ethan Mason, a computer science undergrad at the University of Texas at Austin interested in philosophy, literature, and tech, to name a few things.  
Writing is something I disliked growing up, but as I rekindled my love for reading over the past few years, I became inspired to put my own thoughts out into the world.  
In 2025, I've read:  

  
- The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas
- The Philosophy of the Daodejing by Hans-George Moeller
- The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski
- Anna Karenina by Lev Tolstoy
- The Bell by Iris Murdoch
- The Gate by Natsume Sōseki
- Kusamakura by Natsume Sōseki
