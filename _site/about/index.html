            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I'm Ethan Mason, and this is my blog where I write about philosophy, computer science, literature, and more.</p>
            <img src="/images/pfp.jpg" alt="Profile picture">
            <p>Plutarch once said, "The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled." At the risk of sounding cliché, I 
                really do resonate with that statement. I often fall into the trap of wanting to know everything, and know it instantly.
                But, as Plutarch says, the mind is something that must be built slowly. It requires constant nurturing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love learning. I love feeding the fire. I write infrequently and I write like an amateur, but I truly enjoy it. This 
                blog is a place where I try to foster my own learning through essays, so welcome! I welcome any feedback or discussion, 
                and I hope you're able to find some kindling here for your own fireplace.
            </p>
