In less than two months, I will be graduating with a **B.S. in computer science** from the **University of Texas at Austin**. In order to prevent everything I’ve learned from immediately vanishing from my brain, I’m beginning a series of essays that recaps every class I’ve taken. Hopefully, these essays will also give an insight into the actual content of a computer science degree and prove valuable for prospective computer science students at UT Austin or anywhere else.

## Important Disclaimers

Before I begin, however, I would like to make a few disclaimers:

* **Errors May Occur:** There may be errors at any point in the series. I am not graduating with a 4.0 GPA, and even if I was, the sheer size of the content that will be covered in this series of essays will likely cause some things to slip through the cracks.
* **Non-Comprehensive:** This series is not comprehensive. I will only describe the concepts from each course at a high level for brevity’s sake and to avoid infringing on any of the university’s rules.
* **Varying Detail:** It is possible that certain courses or certain topics within each course overview will be explained in different amounts of detail. While I do my best to treat all topics equally, I am simply more well-versed in some topics than in others.
* **CS Courses Only:** I will discuss only the **computer science courses** I took over the course of my degree.
* **Order of Essays:** The order of the courses discussed in this series is **not** the order in which I took them. They are loosely organized so similar courses follow in sequence.

## The Essay Series Structure

There will be a total of **seven essays**, covering the following course groups:

1.  **Data Structures and Discrete Math**
2.  **Computer Architecture and Algorithms and Complexity**
3.  **Principles of Computer Systems and Computer Networks**
4.  **Data Management and Information Retrieval**
5.  **Ethical Foundations of Computer Science and Software Engineering**
6.  **Principles of Machine Learning I and Artificial Intelligence**
